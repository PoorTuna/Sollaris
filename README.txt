Idea of the game: 
------------------

Your target is to kill as many bosses in a limited amount of lives.

You may explore the limited sized world and break + place blocks as you wish [warning : avoid being suffocated while placing blocks! ]

The game has a lot of big features and small ones, feel free to inspect the code in order to find them!
The code is written via PEP8 rules and is divided to FUNCTIONS and CLASSES.

If were wondering how many lines the code contains :  2,108!
------
Tips + Notes : 
------

1)5 broken blocks =  1 Wood.
2)You'll get building supplies in each day that passes [5 wood].
3)If you get bored in the day make sure you build platforms or dig ones to prepare for the upcoming boss fight!
4)Bosses only spawn in non-odd nights which means that you can also prepare in odd-nights! 
5)Note that the biomes generate in a random order [so if desert generates next to ocean, I'm sorry in advance].

Enjoy!
